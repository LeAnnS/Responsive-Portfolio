      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/LeAnnS.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="LeAnn Sawatzky Photo">

      <p>LeAnn is enrolled in the Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp at the University of Minnesota and is scheduled to graduate in May 2018.  Although it is a challenge to attend classes, complete homework assignments, and work full time, she is looking forward to a new career designing web pages and hopes to use her new skills to contribute to community and charitable organizations.</p>

      <p>LeAnn has been employed in the Architectural/Engineering business for 40 years. The majority of that time has been spent designing plumbing and HVAC systems for Target stores around the country and in Canada.  While she spent many years utilizing Microstation CAD  to develop construction documents, she has also gained extensive experience using REVIT BIM over the last 3 years.  She is currently employed at Nelson-Rudie Associates in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</p>

      <p>LeAnn is a proud mother of two and will soon welcome her first grandchild.  She loves spending time with family and friends and then documenting those memories in a beautiful hand made scrapbook.</p>
